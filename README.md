## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Create or Join a Room** - One player creates a room and shares the code with friends (or adds bot players to fill seats)
2. **Judge Picks Category** - Each round, one player becomes the Judge and picks a category (e.g., "Foods That Slap at 3 AM")
3. **Players Get Unique Numbers** - Non-judge players receive a unique number from 1-10 (no duplicates!)
4. **Submit Your Item** - Pick something from the category that matches your number (1 = worst, 10 = best)
5. **Watch Live Ordering** - As players submit, non-judges see the live sorted list update in real-time
6. **Judge Ranks** - The Judge puts everyone's answers in order from lowest to highest
7. **Score Points** - You earn a point every time the Judge places you at your true position!

## 🏆 Scoring

The Judge ranks each player's answer by **position** (lowest number → highest number).

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Judge places a player at their **correct position** | Player +1 AND Judge +1 |
| Judge gets **ALL positions correct** | Judge +2 bonus |

**First to 10 points wins!**

> 💡 **Strategy Tip**: As a player, try to pick items that could match multiple numbers to confuse the Judge!
